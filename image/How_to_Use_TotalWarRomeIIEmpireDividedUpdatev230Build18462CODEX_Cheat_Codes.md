To use cheat codes in Total War: Rome II - Empire Divided, you will need to download and install a third-party software called CODEX. CODEX is a crack that bypasses the game's DRM protection and allows you to modify the game files. You can find the latest version of CODEX for Total War: Rome II - Empire Divided here: [https://www.skidrowreloaded.com/total-war-rome-ii-empire-divided-update-v2-3-0-build-18462-codex/](https://www.skidrowreloaded.com/total-war-rome-ii-empire-divided-update-v2-3-0-build-18462-codex/)
  
After downloading and installing CODEX, you will need to locate the game's installation folder. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Total War Rome II. In this folder, you will find a file called preferences.script.txt. This is the file that contains the cheat codes. You will need to open this file with a text editor, such as Notepad.
  
In the preferences.script.txt file, you will see a list of variables and values that control various aspects of the game. To activate a cheat code, you will need to change the value of a variable to a desired number or text. For example, if you want to have unlimited money, you will need to find the line that says:

    campaign_difficulty_handicap 0

And change it to:

    campaign_difficulty_handicap 999999

This will give you 999999 gold per turn. You can change this number to any value you want.
