## What is Crack in the World?
 
Crack in the World is a short adventure map focused on story and special effects. In typical adventure fashion, you go around exploring places, talking to NPCs to gather information and items, and unlocking the next part of the story. The map can be completed in approximately 30 - 40 minutes[^1^] [^2^].
 
The story of the map is that your car has broken down and you head to a nearby town to stay the night. You soon learn that something is going on around there. What is that man running the power plant up to? You have to explore the area to find out and stop him[^1^] [^2^]!
 
The map features awesome cutscenes and special effects, such as explosions, earthquakes, lava flows, and more. It also has a custom resource pack with block shapes, textures, sounds, and music that enhance the immersion and atmosphere of the map[^1^] [^2^]. The map has an epic finale that will leave you speechless (no spoilers here)!
 
## How to Install Crack in the World?
 
To play Crack in the World, you need Minecraft version 1.8.1 (no mods). You also need to turn off all other resource packs. There is a custom resource pack in the level directory so if you're playing in single player mode then it should load automatically. If you're playing on a server then the 'resources.zip' file in the level directory can be installed just like a normal resource pack on the clients[^1^] [^2^].
 
If you're playing on a server then you must enable command blocks in the server config. The map looks best when particles are set to "All" or "Decreased" and your render distance is greater than 6 chunks[^1^] [^2^].
