MioPocket (MEE-oh-pok-it) is a collection of free and shareware programs that can run on any Windows CE-based device, such as Mio, Magellan, Navigon, Navman, Sanyo and Asus. It comes with just about everything that you might want: media players, e-book readers, dictionaries, games, image viewers, paint programs, MS Office document viewers, text editors, handwritten note-taking apps, general GPS plotting/mapping apps, appointments/tasks apps, internet apps, registry editors, task managers/switchers, file managers, a contacts app, a calculator, a unit converter, an alarm clock and more. See the Readme file for a full list.
 
MioPocket is not a replacement for MioMap, Mobile Navigator or any other OEM navigation software. It is just a frontend from which you may launch the navigation software that came with your device or that you purchase separately. Note that MioPocket does not come with MioMap, iGo, Garmin, TomTom or any other commercial navigation software. Icons are included for them, but not the programs themselves (since they are not free).
 
MioPocket is free and legal to use, as it consists 100% of freely-distributable content[^1^]. It is also easy to install and uninstall on most devices. Most major Windows CE-based GPS brands have installation instructions in MioPocket's Readme file. For brands that MioPocket does not include specific instructions for, there are also some general instructions for SD-free installation on just about any device[^1^]. However, it is always a good idea to check around online (especially in the gpspassion.com forums) to see if and how others have done it.
 
MioPocket 4.0 Release 68 is the latest version of MioPocket as of August 2020. It has many improvements and bug fixes over previous versions. You can download it from Archive.org[^2^] or from other sources online. If you want to unlock your Windows CE-based GPS device and enjoy its full potential, give MioPocket a try!

## How to install and uninstall MioPocket 4.0 Release 68?
 
The installation and uninstallation of MioPocket 4.0 Release 68 depends on the type and brand of your device. Generally, there are two methods: SD card installation and SD-free installation. SD card installation is easier and safer, but requires an SD card inserted in your device at all times. SD-free installation is more complicated and risky, but does not require an SD card after installation.
 
For SD card installation, you need to format an SD card (preferably at least 256 MB) as FAT or FAT32, copy the contents of the MioPocket folder from the zip file to the root of the SD card, rename one of the files in the root of the SD card to match your device's autorun file name (see the Readme file for details), insert the SD card into your device and turn it on or reset it. MioPocket should start automatically. To uninstall MioPocket, simply remove the SD card from your device and turn it off or reset it.
 
For SD-free installation, you need to copy some files from the zip file to your device's internal memory (usually called My Flash Disk or Resident Flash), modify some registry settings on your device (using a registry editor program), create a backup of your original autorun file (if any) and rename one of the files in your device's internal memory to match your device's autorun file name (see the Readme file for details). Then you need to turn off or reset your device. MioPocket should start automatically. To uninstall MioPocket, you need to reverse the steps that you did for installation (see the Readme file for details).
 
Note that these are general instructions and may not work for all devices. Some devices may require additional steps or modifications. It is highly recommended that you read the Readme file carefully before attempting to install or uninstall MioPocket. It is also advisable that you backup your device's internal memory and registry before making any changes. Installing or uninstalling MioPocket may void your warranty or damage your device if done incorrectly.
